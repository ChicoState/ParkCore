ParkCore started out as a friendly agreement between a local property owner and a student who needed a place to park. The agreement helped them both out: The student, frustrated by expensive and often unavailable parking found the security and proximity of the driveway a perfect solution; the homeowner felt satisfaction in helping out a student and made a little money in the process. 

Secure and convenient parking is an escalating problem around the Chico State campus. Local public transportation is limited; parking passes are an expensive burden placed on community members already maxed out with tuition and rent; empty driveways pose a security risk for homeowners; searching for parking can be frustrating and time-consuming; and hunting for potential spots causes local traffic issues and unnecessary CO2 emissions.

ParkCore offers a solution to these problems. If you have a driveway and would like to be a part of the commuter solution, or if you’re a driver and just want to park hassle-free, then sign up today. It’s that easy to find a spot and go nuts!
